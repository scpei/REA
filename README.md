# REA: Robust Cross-lingual Entity Alignment Between Knowledge Graphs

Our proposed method REA (Robust Entity Alignment) consists of two components: noise detection and noise-aware entity alignment. 

The noise detection is designed by following the adversarial training principle. 
The noise-aware entity alignment is devised by leveraging graph neural network based knowledge graph encoder as the core. In order to mutually boost the performance of the two components, we propose a unified reinforced training strategy to combine them.

REA is a plug-and-play strategy to mitigate the effect of noise in the given labeled entity pairs for entity alignment problem. The idea also can be easily developed for other alignment algorithms.
